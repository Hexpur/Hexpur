# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I'm a beginner programmer passionate about web development. I'm eager to learn and grow in the field of programming. Here’s a bit more about me:<br><br>    🌱 I’m currently learning React<br>    👨‍💻 I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and JavaScript<br>    📚 I'm constantly learning new technologies and improving my skills<br>    ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy playing D&D, gaming, and drawing sketches, all of which inspire my programming creativity.

## Project-Based Learning

I believe that the best way to learn programming is through hands-on experience. That's why I focus on project-based learning. My GitHub repositories include various projects that I have completed to enhance my skills and understanding of different technologies. Each project has a preview link attached, allowing you to see the work in action.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my progress and the different technologies I am working with.
